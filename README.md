This repository is the *Self-Augmentation via Self-Reweighting* (SEAVER) modified version of [the original C-STS models](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/c-sts) for better suiting the C-STS nature.

## Fine-tuning

You can finetune the models described in the paper using the `run_sts.sh` script. For example, to finetune the `princeton-nlp/sup-simcse-roberta-base` model on the C-STS dataset, run the following command:

```bash
MODEL=princeton-nlp/sup-simcse-roberta-base \
ENCODER_TYPE=cross_encoder \
LR=3e-5 \
WD=0.1 \
TRANSFORM=True \
OBJECTIVE=mse \
OUTPUT_DIR=output \
TRAIN_FILE=data/csts_train.csv \
EVAL_FILE=data/csts_validation.csv \
TEST_FILE=data/csts_test.csv \
bash run_sts.sh
```

P.S. Because the method proposed in the article targets cross-encoding, it is necessary to set the `ENCODER_TYPE` to `cross_encoder` in this configuration.

See `run_sts.sh` for a full description of the available options and default values.

## Few-shot Prompting
This part is identical to the steps carried out in [the original C-STS repository](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/c-sts).

## Submitting Test Results

This section submits test results in accordance with the submission method stipulated by the C-STS dataset to prevent leakage of test set labels.

You can scores for your model on the test set by submitting your predictions using the `make_test_submission.py` script as follows:

```bash
python make_test_submission.py your_email@email.com /path/to/your/predictions.json
```

This script expects the test predictions file to be in the format generated automatically by the scripts above; i.e.

  ```json
  {
    "0": 1.0,
    "1": 0.0,
    "...":
    "4731": 0.5
  }
  ```

After submission your results will be emailed to the submitted email address with the relevant filename in the subject.
